pvlib-python
========================================

PVLIB Python is a community supported tool that provides a set of
functions and classes for simulating the performance of photovoltaic
energy systems. PVLIB Python was originally ported from the PVLIB MATLAB
toolbox developed at Sandia National Laboratories and it implements many
of the models and methods developed at the Labs. More information on
Sandia Labs PV performance modeling programs can be found at
https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/. We collaborate with the PVLIB MATLAB project,
but operate independently of it.

The source code for pvlib-python is hosted on `github
<https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python>`_.

Please see the :ref:`installation` page for installation help.

For examples of how to use pvlib-python, please see
:ref:`package_overview` and our `Jupyter Notebook tutorials
<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pvlib/pvlib-python/tree/master/docs/
tutorials/>`_. The documentation assumes general familiarity with
Python, NumPy, and Pandas. Google searches will yield many
excellent tutorials for these packages.

The pvlib-python GitHub wiki has a `Projects and publications that use
pvlib python
<https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/wiki/Projects-and-publications-
that-use-pvlib-python>`_ page for inspiration and listing of your
application.

There is a :ref:`variable naming convention <variables_style_rules>` to
ensure consistency throughout the library.
